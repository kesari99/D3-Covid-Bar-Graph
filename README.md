# COVID-19 Daily New Cases Bar Chart

It includes features such as dark mode, adjustable date ranges, responsive resizing, and animated tooltips.

## Features

- **Responsive Chart**: Automatically resizes based on container width.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over bars to view detailed statistics.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes.
- **Date Range Options**: Buttons to display 30, 60, or 90 days of data.
- **Loading & Error States**: User-friendly feedback during data fetching or error scenarios.
